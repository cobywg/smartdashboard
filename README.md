# Why A choropleth map
A choropleth map is a type of thematic map that represents data using different colors or patterns to convey the intensity or distribution of a particular variable across geographic regions. In the context of flu data, a choropleth map can visually depict the spread and severity of flu cases in various areas, such as states or countries. Lighter colors typically represent lower levels of flu activity, while darker colors indicate higher levels. By visualizing flu data on a choropleth map, users can quickly identify areas with high flu activity and gain insights into regional trends and patterns. This facilitates informed decision-making for public health officials, researchers, and the general public in monitoring and responding to flu outbreaks.
